## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.5] - 2025-10-07

### Fixed
- **Streamlined Debug Output**: Removed excessive debugging that may have interfered with execution
  - Eliminated verbose state change reporting and command echoing
  - Removed redundant initialization messages and feature loading output
  - Kept essential protocol responses ("READY", "COMPLETE") for Python script compatibility
  - Reduced flash usage by 3.5KB (59144 vs 62616 bytes)

### Enhanced
- **Protocol Reliability**: Maintained multi-command parsing fix for BMPStart/SIZE handling
  - Handles cases where Python sends commands rapidly in single serial read
  - Processes BMPStart and SIZE commands seamlessly without hanging
  - Eliminates protocol mismatch issues that caused transmission failures

### Performance
- **Reduced Overhead**: Minimal debug output reduces serial communication overhead
- **Faster Execution**: Less string processing and serial output during bitmap reception
- **Memory Efficiency**: RAM 3.3% (3232 bytes), Flash 11.3% (59144 bytes) - 3.5KB reduction

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Clean, minimal serial output focused on essential information
- ‚úÖ Reliable "READY" response for Python script handshake
- ‚úÖ Successful bitmap transmission without hanging
- ‚úÖ Tiger image display on Display 1
- ‚úÖ Display 2 frame stability during transmission

## [2.0.4] - 2025-10-07

### Fixed
- **Serial Command Parsing**: Fixed critical issue where multiple commands were received in single read
  - Arduino was receiving `'BMPStart\nSIZE:157,105\n'` instead of separate commands
  - Enhanced `handleStartMarker()` to detect and split multiple commands
  - Added `processSizeCommand()` helper function for reusable SIZE command processing
  - Python script no longer hangs waiting for "READY" response
  - Bitmap transmission protocol now works reliably

### Enhanced
- **Debug Output**: Added detailed logging for multi-command detection and processing
- **Frame Renderer Monitoring**: Added debug logging to `redrawFrame()` to track Display 2 reinitialization
- **Protocol Robustness**: Improved command parsing handles both single and multi-command scenarios

### Technical Details
- `Serial.readStringUntil('\n')` was reading multiple commands when Python sent them rapidly
- Command splitting logic detects embedded `\n` characters and processes commands sequentially
- Maintains backward compatibility with single command processing
- Enhanced error messages show exact received command strings

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ "READY" response sent reliably
- ‚úÖ Bitmap transmission completes without hanging
- ‚úÖ Tiger image displays on Display 1
- ‚úÖ Display 2 frame remains stable during transmission

## [2.0.3] - 2025-10-07

### Fixed
- **Compiler Warning**: Fixed non-virtual destructor warning in DisplayController
  - Changed from dynamic allocation (`new`/`delete`) to static allocation
  - Eliminated undefined behavior risk from deleting objects without virtual destructors
  - Memory management now handled automatically by C++ RAII principles

### Technical Details
- DisplayController now uses static Adafruit_ST7735 objects instead of dynamic allocation
- Display instances (display0, display1) are created as member objects
- Pointer array maintained for compatibility with existing API
- Automatic destruction eliminates manual memory management
- Memory usage slightly increased (3232 vs 3088 bytes) due to static allocation

### Performance
- Memory usage: RAM 3.3% (3232 bytes), Flash 11.9% (62168 bytes)
- Build status: ‚úÖ Clean compilation with no warnings

## [2.0.2] - 2025-10-07

### Fixed
- **Protocol Debugging Enhancement**: Added comprehensive debug logging to identify protocol issues
  - Enhanced BitmapReceiver with detailed state and command logging
  - Added debug output for size command parsing and validation
  - Added state change tracking to identify protocol flow issues
  - Improved error messages with specific failure reasons

### Documentation
- **PROTOCOL_MISMATCH_FIX.md**: Created troubleshooting guide for Python script protocol mismatch
  - Identified root cause: using `bitmap_sender.py` instead of `bitmap_sender_fixed.py`
  - Documented correct protocol sequence: BMPStart ‚Üí SIZE ‚Üí READY ‚Üí pixels ‚Üí BMPEnd
  - Provided step-by-step solution and verification steps

### Technical Details  
- Arduino firmware expects BMPStart/SIZE/BMPEnd protocol (implemented in bitmap_sender_fixed.py)
- Old bitmap_sender.py uses START/END protocol (incompatible)
- Debug messages help identify which script is being used and where protocol fails
- Enhanced serial output for easier troubleshooting during development

### Performance
- Memory usage: RAM 3.1% (3088 bytes), Flash 11.7% (61112 bytes) - slight increase due to debug strings

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-07

### Fixed
- **Display Reinitialization Issue**: Fixed both displays reinitializing when bitmap upload began
  - Added protection against multiple DisplayController initialization calls
  - Added protection against multiple FrameRenderer initialization calls
  - Added debug logging to identify reinitialization sources
  - FrameRenderer now only clears Display 2 screen during initial setup, not during normal operation
  - Improved CS control timing consistency

### Technical Details
- DisplayController.initialize() now uses static flag to prevent multiple calls
- FrameRenderer.initialize() checks frameDrawn flag to prevent multiple initialization
- Added debug messages to identify when displays are being reinitialized
- Bitmap reception on Display 1 now only affects Display 1, not Display 2
- CS control optimizations maintain display isolation during operations

### Performance
- Memory usage: RAM 3.1% (3088 bytes), Flash 11.6% (60648 bytes)
- Build status: ‚úÖ Successful compilation
