    "## Quick Reference\n",
    "- **Problem:** Multiple calibration dialog bugs and missing features\n",
    "- **Solution:** Fixed shift-click, bounds, offset loading, cancel behavior, added orientation buttons\n",

    "# 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "## What were we trying to solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "User reported 7 issues with the calibration dialog:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image transfer speed (minor improvement only)\n",
    "2. Shift-click width/height adjustment not working correctly\n",
    "3. Bounds calculations were incorrect\n",
    "4. Cancel button didn't restore config file values\n",
    "5. Missing orientation rotation buttons\n",
    "6. Current offset values not loading when dialog opens\n",
    "7. Spinbox values not updating after adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shift+click behavior**: Should adjust width/height symmetrically\n",
    "  - Top+: Increase height (move top up AND bottom down)\n",
    "  - Left+: Increase width (move left left AND right right)\n",
    "- **Bounds**: Based on display dimensions, not hardcoded ±50\n",
    "- **Cancel**: Should restore values from .config file\n",
    "- **Orientation**: Need buttons for all 4 orientations\n",
    "- **State persistence**: Values should load from firmware on dialog open\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pain Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inefficient iteration: Issues discovered during testing, not design\n",
    "- Multiple rounds of fixes needed\n",
    "- Confusion about bounds calculation logic\n",
    "- Firmware/Python state synchronization issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Shift-click adjusts width/height correctly\n",
    "- [x] Bounds calculated from display dimensions\n",
    "- [x] Current offsets load on dialog open\n",
    "- [x] Cancel restores .config values via UPDATE_CONFIG\n",
    "- [x] Orientation buttons change display rotation\n",
    "- [x] All spinboxes update after adjustments"

    "\n",
    "1. **Shift-click**: Both edges moved same direction (resize instead of translate)\n",

    "3. **Loading order**: Offsets loaded AFTER spinboxes created (values not shown)\n",
    "4. **Cancel behavior**: Only reset to session start, not .config file\n",
    "5. **Orientation**: No UI controls, had to restart firmware\n",
