Understood! You've realized Option 5 won't work for your needs. Let me undo the changes and restore to the clean baseline.


cp src/main.cpp.clean src/main.cpp
Changes undone! We're back to the clean single-display baseline.

You're right that Option 5 (multiplexing) wouldn't work for your use case since you need simultaneous dual display operation, not switching between them.

Would you like me to present the remaining viable options for achieving simultaneous dual display operation while working around the SWRESET broadcast issue?

The remaining options that would allow simultaneous operation are:

Option 1: Sequential Delayed Initialization
Option 2: Hardware Pin Control Workaround (RST pin to 3.3V)
Option 3: Custom Library Initialization
Option 4: Library Fork/Modification
Which approach would you like me to implement for true simultaneous dual display operation?

thanks. we will continue, tomorrow.

You're welcome!

Just to confirm - we're at a good stopping point with:

Clean baseline restored (main.cpp.clean)
Workflow policy documented in WORKFLOW.md
Root cause identified (SWRESET broadcast issue in Adafruit ST7735 library)
Several viable solution options available for simultaneous dual display operation
When we continue tomorrow, you can choose from the remaining options:

Option 1: Sequential Delayed Initialization
Option 2: Hardware Pin Control Workaround
Option 3: Custom Library Initialization
Option 4: Library Fork/Modification
Have a good evening, and we'll pick up where we left off tomorrow!
