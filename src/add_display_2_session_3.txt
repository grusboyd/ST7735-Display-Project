Great idea! Hereâ€™s a summary of your additional requirements and a suggestion for extensible design:

Additional requirements:

Store the current display data for each display so it can be restored after calibration or when switching modes.
Track what is currently being displayed (waiting image, bitmap, calibration frame, volatile data, etc.) for each display.
Only overwrite/restoration if the current image is not the waiting image.
Use variables to remember display state and type for future extensibility.
Design suggestion:

For each display, create a struct or class (or a set of variables) to store:
Frame parameters (origin, width, height, thickness)
Display state/type (enum: WAITING, BITMAP, CALIBRATION, DATA, etc.)
Any additional data needed for restoration (e.g., last bitmap, calibration settings)
When switching to calibration mode, save the current display state/data.
After calibration, restore the previous display data if needed.
All display operations (drawing, updating, restoring) should reference these variables.
Next step options:

Define a DisplayState struct/class and state enum for each display.
Implement logic to save/restore display data and state.
Integrate this with the calibration menu and extensible display selection.
