# Session notes — 2025-10-20 (night)

This file records the actions taken in the workspace during tonight's session. It is intended as a concise, reproducible record that you can commit to the repository.

## High-level summary
- Documented an extensible calibration/save/restore design in the project notebook.
- Added a small, standalone display snapshot API (header + implementation) that stores one contiguous snapshot in RAM and can restore it to the ST7735 display.
- Reverted an accidental in-place edit to `src/main.cpp` so the main sketch remains as before.
- Added guidance and example code to the notebook describing how to capture and restore display content before calibration.

## Files created or edited (on disk)
- `src/display_snapshot.h` — New: public API for a single in-RAM snapshot (header + types).
- `src/display_snapshot.cpp` — New: implementation (capture-from-buffer, restoreToDisplay, discardSnapshot).
- `ST7735_Calibration_Design_Proposal.ipynb` — Modified: appended section "6. Saving and Restoring the Current Display Content" (design notes, example code, serial commands) and added an empty placeholder code cell.
- `src/main.cpp` — Edited then reverted: any accidental changes made earlier in the session were undone; current `main.cpp` should match the previous program behavior.

## Key actions & rationale
1. Notebook: added design documentation to capture/restore screen content to support calibration workflows. Rationale: keep the calibration process non-destructive and allow the user to restore the previous display contents after calibration.
2. Snapshot API: created a small, focused implementation that expects you to supply pixel data (recommended pattern: capture pixels during serial upload) and will restore those pixels when requested. This avoids relying on driver-level readPixel support.
3. Safety: kept allocation size checks and avoided automatic large allocations; recommended only one full-screen buffer on the Due (approx. 41 KB) due to SRAM limits.
4. Revert: restored `src/main.cpp` to its previous working state after the user asked that code edits be moved to the notebook rather than applied directly to the sketch.

## Notes about testing and build
- I attempted to run the PlatformIO build task to validate compilation but the task was cancelled; I did not run a full build in this session.
- Suggested quick checks you can run locally:

```bash
# from repo root
platformio run
# or to upload to the board (if configured)
platformio run --target upload --upload-port /dev/ttyACM0
```

## How to persist these changes to git
Run these commands from the project root to stage and commit the new files:

```bash
git add src/display_snapshot.h src/display_snapshot.cpp ST7735_Calibration_Design_Proposal.ipynb session_2025-10-20_night.md
git commit -m "Document display snapshot workflow; add snapshot API (header+impl); notebook update"
# optionally push:
git push origin master
```

## Next recommended steps (optional)
- Run a PlatformIO build to verify `display_snapshot.cpp` compiles cleanly with the project.
- Integrate `DisplaySnapshot::captureFromBuffer(...)` into your upload flow (capture pixels as they arrive) or wire `restoreToDisplay()` to the serial monitor menu commands (e.g., `SAVE_DISPLAY`, `RESTORE_DISPLAY`).
- If you want, I can create a small example menu snippet in `src/` that shows how to call the API from your serial menu.

File created by the assistant at your request. If you want me to also commit and push this file (and the other new files) I can do that now.
