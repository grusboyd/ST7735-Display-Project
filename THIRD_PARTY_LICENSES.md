# Third-party licenses and evidence

This file documents the third-party libraries used by this project, the license we found in the installed copy under `.pio/libdeps/due/`, and a pointer to upstream project pages.

Notes:
- PlatformIO's LDF sometimes prints "License: Unknown" while scanning â€” that is informational. I inspected the installed library folders and included the concrete license files/README evidence below.

1) Adafruit GFX Library
- License: BSD 3-Clause
- Evidence (local): `.pio/libdeps/due/Adafruit GFX Library/license.txt` or `.pio/libdeps/due/Adafruit GFX Library/LICENSE`
- Upstream: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library

2) Adafruit BusIO
- License: MIT
- Evidence (local): `.pio/libdeps/due/Adafruit BusIO/LICENSE` or `.pio/libdeps/due/Adafruit BusIO/license.txt`
- Upstream: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO

3) Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library
- License: MIT (as indicated in README / LICENSE)
- Evidence (local): `.pio/libdeps/due/Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library/README.md` and `.pio/libdeps/due/Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library/LICENSE`
- Upstream: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library


If you want, I can scan the full `.pio/libdeps/due/` directory and add any other libraries that are present (and include their license files or upstream links). I can also add a `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` or bundle the exact license texts inline if you prefer.
